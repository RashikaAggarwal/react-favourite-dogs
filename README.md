# React WebApp - Favourite Dogs

This repository is a react webapp that presents a gallery of 6 random dog images from https://random.dog/woof.json. It allows the user to choose one (or more) as favorite dogs. If the user doesnâ€™t like any of the six images, one can click on refresh/next button to get 6 new images. The user can click on favourites button to view its favourite images. This website is a flexbox gallery and hence rearranges itself correctly for mobile screens.

## RoadMap

- Better Designing of the React WebApp using advanced syting features.
- Styling the images on events like focused, clicked etc. to enhance the user interaction.
- Implementation of React redux for maintaining the states effectively.
- Implementation of Loaders while waiting for the component to render the images.
